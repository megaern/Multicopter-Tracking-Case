(Third International Multicopter Girls Camp 2012 at Tu-Ilmenau, Germany)

The goal of this Multicopter Tracking Case Study is: 
Controlled mobility of a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle): Actively follow the position of a moving short-range radio transmitter, by:
- Evaluating the current relative GPS position (x,y), in meters
- Evaluating the received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
- Direction of Arrival is unknown → spatial exploration for localization
